    <p>So far, we have only learned how to represent positive numbers in binary. However, there are
        schemes to represent negative numbers in binary as well. Consider the sign and magnitude scheme:
        given a binary number, the leftmost bit represents the sign (if it’s 1, the number is negative, if it’s 0,
        the number is positive), and the rest of the bits represent the number itself. For example, $0b1100_2$
        would be $-0b0100_2$. </p>
