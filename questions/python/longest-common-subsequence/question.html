    Now we will solve the Longest-Common-Subsequence problem. Given two strings x and y, we define their longest-common-subsequence (or lcs) as the longest substring they have 
    in common, where a substring is defined as a sequence of adjacent characters. For example “ws eat” is a substring of “cows eat yay”, but “coyay” is not. 
</p> 
<p>
    For example <code>lcs(“crows eat yay”, “my cows eat hay”)</code> is <code>“ows eat ”</code>. As another example, <code>lcs(“pickle”, “orcs”)</code> is <code>“c”</code>. 
    If two strings have no substrings in common, their lcs is the empty string. You may not need all lines. Do not worry about efficiency.
</p>
<p>
Syntax hints: <br>
Given a bunch of strings, you can use the <code>longest</code> function to return the longest of them, e.g. <code>longest(“let”, “us”, “slather”, “ourselves”, “with”, “pizza”)  
</code> would return <code>“ourselves”</code>. It also works with a list, e.g. <code>longest([“am”, “ham”, “bell”])</code> is <code>“bell”</code>.

<p><strong>Warning: This problem is particularly challenging, it might be the hardest Python question ever appeared on CS10.</strong></p>
